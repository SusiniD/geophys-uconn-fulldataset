# Dataset description
The 5 subfolders contain the pseudospectral synthetic seismograms (SH) of tested models, including five random realizations in each model for MODELS 2 - 5. \n
Each text file contains 116 synthetic seismograms for source-receiver great circle distances ranging from 5 - 120 degrees. And there are 32768 time samples per seismogram. \n
Column 1 = Time (s)
Column 2 = Source- receiver great circle distance (degrees)
Column 3 = Amplitude (ground velocity)
